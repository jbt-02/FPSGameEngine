🛠️ First Principles FPS Engine
Overview

This project is my first game engine, built from scratch with the goal of deeply understanding how game engines work under the hood.
The engine is designed specifically to support a basic first-person shooter (FPS) game.

Rather than using an existing engine like Unity or Unreal, this project focuses on learning and implementing core engine systems manually, including rendering, input handling, physics, and game logic.

## This is not meant to be a production-ready engine. It is a learning engine built to:

- Understand low-level systems

- Practice engine architecture

- Learn graphics programming

- Strengthen C++ and systems programming skills

## Goals

- Build a minimal but complete game engine

- Support a playable first-person shooter demo

- Learn how real engines are structured internally

- Avoid black-box abstractions as much as possible
